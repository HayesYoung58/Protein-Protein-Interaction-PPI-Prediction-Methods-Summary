# Introduction to Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Prediction {#intro}

Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are central to almost all biological processes, including signal transduction, metabolic regulation, transcriptional control, immune responses, and complex assembly. Understanding and predicting PPIs is therefore fundamental in fields such as structural biology, molecular biophysics, drug discovery, and systems biology.

Experimental techniques—such as **Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H)**, **Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)**, **affinity purification–mass spectrometry (AP–MS)**, and **cross-linking MS**—provide powerful ways to detect interactions, but these approaches can be costly, low-throughput, or limited in coverage. As a result, **computational prediction of PPIs** has become essential for large-scale screening and mechanistic understanding.

This chapter provides an overview of the **main computational paradigms** used in PPI prediction and outlines their conceptual differences, input requirements, and typical applications.

## 1.1 Why Computational PPI Prediction Matters {-}

Computational models help address several limitations of experimental methods:

- **High throughput**: Predict interactions at the proteome scale.  
- **Low cost**: Reduce the need for extensive wet-lab screening.  
- **Hypothesis generation**: Identify candidates for validation.  
- **Structural insight**: Predict binding interfaces and complex conformations.  
- **Integration of diverse data sources**: Combine sequence, structure, evolution, and literature.

Computational predictions are especially useful when:

- structural data is incomplete,  
- experimental conditions are difficult to mimic,  
- high-throughput screening is required (e.g., drug target identification), or  
- evolution-based insights can reveal conserved interaction patterns.

## 1.2 Categories of Computational PPI Prediction Methods {-}

Current computational approaches to PPI prediction can be broadly divided into **five major categories**, each with different assumptions, data dependencies, and output types.

These categories correspond to Chapters 2–6 of this book.

### **1. Docking-Based (Structure-Based) Methods** {-}
Use 3D protein structures as input and generate possible complex conformations using:

- rigid-body or flexible-body docking  
- energy scoring  
- interface restraints  

Representative tools: **HADDOCK**, **HDOCK**, **ClusPro**, **ZDOCK**, **GRAMM**, **pyDock**

These methods aim to predict **how** two proteins bind (binding mode).

---

### **2. Structure-Based Interface Analysis** {-}
These methods evaluate **existing protein complexes** to determine whether:

- the interface is physically realistic,  
- the complex is biologically meaningful,  
- the interaction is stable.  

Representative tool: **PDBePISA**

Often used after docking or AlphaFold-Multimer predictions.

---

### **3. Sequence / Knowledge–Based Prediction** {-}
These models rely on:

- amino acid sequences  
- evolutionary co-variation  
- protein domains  
- biological networks  
- literature mining  

Representative tools: **STRING**, **PrePPI**, **PPI-Miner**, **COTH**

These methods answer **whether** two proteins might interact, but rarely predict complex geometry.

---

### **4. Deep Learning–Based PPI Prediction** {-}
End-to-end neural architectures that use learned representations (embeddings) from:

- Transformers  
- protein language models (e.g., ESM, ProtBERT)  
- graph neural networks (GNNs)  

Representative tools/models: **D-SCRIPT**, **DeepPurpose (PPI module)**, **MAPE-PPI**

These approaches can capture subtle patterns beyond handcrafted features.

---

### **5. Structure Generation Approaches** {-}
These methods directly generate complex structures from sequence inputs.

Representative model: **AlphaFold-Multimer**

Features:

- predicts complex geometry  
- outputs confidence metrics (pLDDT, ipTM, pTM)  
- can be combined with docking-based refinement or interface scoring  

This paradigm is increasingly used in structural proteomics and binder engineering.

## 1.3 When to Use Each Category {-}

| Question | Recommended Methods |
|---------|----------------------|
| “Do A and B likely interact?” | STRING, PrePPI, D-SCRIPT, DeepPurpose |
| “What might the interface look like?” | Docking tools (HADDOCK, ClusPro, HDOCK) |
| “Is this predicted complex stable?” | PDBePISA |
| “Can we generate a complex structure directly from sequence?” | AlphaFold-Multimer |
| “I want large-scale computational screening.” | Sequence-based + Deep Learning models |

This book organizes the chapters according to this logic.
