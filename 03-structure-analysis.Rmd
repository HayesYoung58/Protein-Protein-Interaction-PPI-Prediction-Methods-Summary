# Structure-Based Interface Analysis (PDBePISA) {#structure-analysis}

Structure-based interface analysis focuses on evaluating **whether a predicted or experimentally determined protein complex is physically meaningful and biologically relevant**.  
Among all available tools, **PDBePISA** is the most widely used platform for analyzing macromolecular interfaces, assemblies, and stability.

This chapter summarizes the principles, metrics, and practical applications of PDBePISA in protein–protein interaction (PPI) studies.

## 3.1 Purpose of Structure-Based Interface Analysis {-}

Docking methods (Chapter 2) can generate thousands of possible binding orientations.  
Structure analysis tools—such as **PDBePISA**—help answer critical questions:

- Is the predicted interface **thermodynamically stable**?
- Is the interaction **likely to occur in solution**, not just in the crystal?
- What is the **interface area**, **buried surface**, or **energetic contributions**?
- Which **residues** form the interface?
- Are the **hydrogen bonds**, **salt bridges**, and **hydrophobic contacts** plausible?
- Does the complex appear to be a **biologically relevant assembly**?

Thus, PDBePISA is a *validation* and *interpretation* tool for structural models, whether derived from:

- docking  
- AlphaFold-Multimer  
- cryo-EM  
- crystallography  
- NMR

## 3.2 What Is PDBePISA? {-}

**PDBePISA** (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces & Assemblies) is a web server developed by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) for:

- calculating **macromolecular interfaces**
- analyzing **biological assemblies**
- estimating **thermodynamic stability**
- identifying **interface residues**, contacts, and networks

PISA operates on **atomic-level structures** from PDB or user-uploaded models.

## 3.3 How PDBePISA Works {-}

PISA evaluates protein–protein interfaces using:

### **1. Buried Surface Area (BSA)** {-}
The area lost upon complex formation (Å²).  
Large BSA values (≥ 1,000–2,000 Å²) typically indicate stable interfaces.

### **2. Solvation Free Energy Gain (ΔG<sub>int</sub>)** {-}
Estimates the free energy change associated with interface formation.

- **Negative values** → stable interaction  
- **More negative** = stronger predicted interaction  

### **3. Hydrogen Bond and Salt Bridge Networks** {-}
PISA identifies:

- H-bonds (distance + angle criteria)  
- salt bridges (charged side-chain interactions)  
- hydrophobic patches  

### **4. Interface Residue Mapping** {-}
Provides detailed residue-level interactions, including:

- donor/acceptor atoms  
- contact distances  
- contributing side chains  

### **5. Biological Assembly Prediction** {-}
PISA distinguishes between:

- **biologically relevant interfaces**  
- **crystallographic artifacts (crystal contacts)**  

based on thermodynamic scoring and symmetry analysis.

## 3.4 Key Outputs of PDBePISA {-}

When a structure is analyzed, PISA provides:

### **• Interface Summary** {-}
- Interface area  
- Solvation energy  
- Number of hydrogen bonds  
- Number of salt bridges  
- Hydrophobic contacts  

### **• Assembly Summary** {-}
Predicted quaternary structures (e.g., dimer, trimer, tetramer).

### **• Stability Prediction** {-}
Includes:

- ΔG<sub>diss</sub> — estimated dissociation free energy  
- Complex stability score  

A **positive ΔG<sub>diss</sub>** indicates the complex is stable in solution.

### **• Detailed Contact Map** {-}
Residue-by-residue interface interactions, useful for:

- mutagenesis design  
- engineering  
- hotspot identification  
- cross-model comparison

## 3.5 When to Use PDBePISA {-}

PDBePISA is useful in the following scenarios:

### **1. After Docking (Chapter 2)** {-}
To validate whether docking poses are:

- physically reasonable  
- likely stable in solution  
- consistent with known interaction patterns  

### **2. After AlphaFold-Multimer Prediction (Chapter 6)** {-}
AlphaFold often predicts multimers, but not all interfaces are realistic.  
Use PISA to check:

- interface area  
- ΔG<sub>int</sub>  
- hydrogen bond network  
- potential crystal-like contacts  
- multimer assembly correctness  

### **3. Crystal Structure Interpretation** {-}
To determine if biological assemblies differ from PDB’s asymmetric unit.

### **4. Identifying Potential Hotspots** {-}
Residues with strong contributions to binding energy can be used for:

- mutagenesis  
- binder design  
- inhibitor development

## 3.6 PDBePISA vs. Docking Scores {-}

| Metric | Docking Tools | PDBePISA |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Purpose | Ranking poses | Validating physicochemical plausibility |
| Type | Empirical/physics scoring | Thermodynamic + geometric analysis |
| Outputs | Pose score, clusters | ΔG<sub>int</sub>, ΔG<sub>diss</sub>, BSA, residue interactions |
| Sensitivity | Sensitive to scoring function | Sensitive to interface geometry |
| Best used for | Pose selection | Biological relevance evaluation |

Docking answers:  
**“Which orientation seems best?”** 

PISA answers:  
**“Is this orientation stable and realistic?”**

## 3.7 Practical Workflow Integration {-}

### **A recommended pipeline integrating Chapter 2 and 3:** {-}

1. **Generate monomer structures**  
   AlphaFold2 / ESMFold / experimental structures

2. **Initial docking**  
   ZDOCK / HDOCK / ClusPro to generate large pose sets

3. **Refinement** 
   HADDOCK / RosettaDock / AlphaFold-Multimer

4. **Interface analysis using PISA**
   - Confirm interface area size  
   - Check ΔG<sub>int</sub> sign  
   - Check the number of H-bonds / salt bridges  
   - Ensure plausible packing geometry  

5. **Ranking + filtering**
   Combine docking score + PISA metrics

6. **Experimental design**
   Use interface hotspots to design mutations for validation

## 3.8 Advantages and Limitations {-}

### **Advantages** {-}
- Provides **residue-level** and **energy-based** insight  
- Distinguishes real interfaces from crystal artifacts  
- Applicable to **any structural model**  
- Very intuitive visualization  

### **Limitations** {-}
- Requires accurate atomic coordinates  
- Does not generate poses (not a docking tool)  
- Energetics are approximate, not true MD/DFT energies  
- Sensitive to model quality (garbage-in → garbage-out)  

---

## 3.9 Summary {-}

PDBePISA is an essential tool for validating and interpreting PPI structural models.  
It complements the docking methods described in Chapter 2 and the structure-generation models of Chapter 6.

In typical workflows, PISA is used to:

- assess interface stability  
- evaluate docking poses  
- validate AlphaFold-Multimer complexes  
- identify interface residues  
- explore biological assemblies  

This makes it one of the most valuable and reliable tools for structure-based PPI analysis.
